### The Ten Commandments

#### The First Commandment

When recurring on a list of atoms, `lat`, ask two questions about it: `(null? lat)` and `else`.
When recurring on a number, `n`, ask two questions about it: `(zero? n)` and `else`.
When recurr on a list of S-expressions, `l`, ask three questions about it: `(null? l)`, `(atom? (car l))`, and `else`.

#### The Second Commandment

Use `cons` to build lists.

#### The Third Commandment

When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then `cons` it onto the natural recursion.

#### The Fourth Commandment

Always change at least one argument while recurring.
When recurring on a list of atoms, `lat`, use `(cdr lat)`.
When recurring on a number, `n`, use `(sub1 n)`.
And when recurring on a list of S-expressions, `l`, use `(car l)` and `(cdr l)` if neither `(null? l)` nor `(atom? (car l))` are true.

It must be changed to be closer to termination.
The changing argument must be tested in the termination condition:
when using `cdr`, test termination with `null?` and when using `sub1`, test termination with `zero?`.

#### The Fifth Commandment

When building a value with `+`, always use o for the value of the terminating line, for adding 0 does not change the value of an addition.

When building a value with `âœ•`, always use 1 for the value of the terminating line, for multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a multiplication.

When building a value with `cons`, always consider `()` for the value of the terminating line.

#### The Sixth Commandment

Simplify only after the funciton is correct.

#### The Seventh Commandment

Recur on the *subparts* that are of the same nature:

- On the sublists of a list.
- On the subexpressions of an arithmetic expression.

#### The Eighth Commandment

Use help functions to abastract from representations.

#### The Ninth Commandment

Abstract common patterns with a new function.

#### The Tenth Commandment

Build functions to collect more than one value at a time.

### The Five Rules

#### The Law of Car

The primitive `car` is defined only for non-empty lists.

#### The Law of Cdr

The primitive `cdr` is defined only for non-empty lists.
The `cdr` of any non-empty list is always another list.

#### The Law of Cons

The primitive `cons` takes two arguments.
The second argument to `cons` must be a list.
The result is a list.

#### The Law of Null?

The primitive `null?` is defined only for lists.

#### The Law of Eq?

The primitive `eq?` takes two arguments.
Each must be a non-numeric atom.
